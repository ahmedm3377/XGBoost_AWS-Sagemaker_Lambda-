# XGBoost_AWS-Sagemaker_Lambda-
XGBoost Model Deployment with AWS SageMaker &amp; Lambda
Description:
This repository showcases an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using the Iris dataset with XGBoost, AWS SageMaker, and AWS Lambda. It demonstrates how to train, deploy, and serve real-time predictions using a fully managed and serverless AWS architecture.

ðŸ”§ Features
* Preprocessing and training an XGBoost classifier on the Iris dataset using SageMaker.

* Deploying the trained model as a SageMaker endpoint.

* Creating an AWS Lambda function to perform real-time inference by invoking the SageMaker endpoint.

* Exposing the Lambda function via API Gateway for RESTful access.

* Modular and easy-to-extend code for other classification datasets.

ðŸ“¦ Stack
* ###Dataset: Iris (scikit-learn)

* ###Model: XGBoost (multi-class classification)

* ###Cloud: AWS SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM

This project is a great starting point for ML engineers and developers interested in serving XGBoost models with serverless AWS components.
